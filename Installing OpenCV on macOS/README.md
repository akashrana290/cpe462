# Installing OpenCV for macOS Big Sur (11.2.3)
* This folder goes into how I installed OpenCV on my MacBook Pro. For reference, I have an Intel CPU and not an M1. 

### 1. Install Python3 and Pip3

This can be done by opening terminal and first checking to see which Python version is currently installed.

To check the version, type this: 
```
python --version
```
If you see Python 2.x.x, continue with step 1
